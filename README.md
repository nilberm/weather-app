# Overview

As a software engineer aiming to enhance my JavaScript skills, I developed this project to deepen my understanding of the language's syntax and key features. The goal was to create a small application that interacts with an external API, handles user input, and updates the user interface dynamically based on the results.

The software demonstrates how to fetch real-time weather data for the userâ€™s current location, as well as how to search for a city and display its temperature using the OpenWeather API. This project showcases asynchronous programming with fetch, handling user geolocation, and managing the UI with dynamic data updates.

The primary purpose of this software is to solidify my ability to integrate APIs with JavaScript and gain more experience in writing clean, modular, and reusable code.

# Development Environment

For the development of this software, I used:

 - Vite as the build tool, providing a fast development experience.
 - Visual Studio Code as the code editor.
 - JavaScript (ES6+), focusing on modern features like arrow functions, modules, and async/await.
 - HTML/CSS for the basic structure and styling of the app.
 - OpenWeather API for fetching real-time weather data.

Libraries/Tools:

 - Vite
 - OpenWeather API

# Future Work

There are several areas where this project can be improved or extended in the future:

 - Implement error handling for invalid city names or failed API requests.
 - Add support for more detailed weather information, such as wind speed, humidity, and forecasts.
 - Improve the user interface with better styling and animations.
